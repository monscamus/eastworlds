## Eastworlds Public Website

Eastworlds is the east of England world-building forum. We welcome people from across all genres including science fiction, fantasy, history, horror and many others. If you don't live in the east or even in the UK - still get in touch. Our events are set in the East but we love to discuss world building with as many and as diverse a group as we possibly can.
