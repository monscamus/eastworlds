      Eastworlds is the east of England world-building forum. We welcome people from across all genres
      including science fiction, fantasy, history, horror and many others. If you don&apos;t live in the east or even in the 
      UK still get in touch. Our events are set in the East but we love to discuss world building with as many and as diverse 
      a group as we possibly can.

        Eastworlds acts as an ecumenical council for groups like the BSFA, BFS, Mythohistorical Society, Anglia Ruskin university, UEA, Cambridge Univeristy,
