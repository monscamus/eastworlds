The exhibition, Lunar Lullabies, opens on Saturday 8th June from 10.30am.  Firstsite has organised a number of mini activities between noon and 4pm.  I don’t know what’s been organised other than the local astronomy group, Tiptree Stargazers, will be there with their solar scopes (yes, that’s plural), so fingers crossed for good weather.   Oh, yes, I forgot, I’ll also be giving a 15minute talk about aerospace art in general and my work in particular.  

There will be three other UK members of the International Association of Astronomical Artists exhibiting and I know them - absolutely stunning work. There will also be three or four other UK artists where aerospace figures strongly in their work, but I don’t know them so it will be as much of a delightful surprise to me as it will be to you.  

Everyone is invited, so the more the merrier.  If you think you can organise the group to pitch up on the 8th then that would be great, otherwise we can go with your plan of getting the group together another time - and of course I’ll be there for you all.  

There’s a public P&D car park at the back of the gallery, but no shortcut into the gallery from there.  The gallery is all on one level with easy access.  It even has a lovely cafe. There are oodles of choice as far as food outlets go, if you Google Map Firstsite you can see for yourself.
