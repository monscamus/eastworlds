# THE BIG SMACKDOWN - Science Fiction Vs Fantasy!

**Friday 18th of July 2024 6pm onwards.**

![Meet at the Moon, Science Fiction Vs Fantasy or Does Scantasy exist?](/images/meetatthemoon2.jpg)
In its role as the arbiter of world-building genres, Eastworlders will host a tongue-in-cheek battle of the titans: Science
Fiction versus Fantasy. 

SF was first: therefore it's the mother of fantasy. It's more demanding, after all *anything* can be fantasy. 

Fantasy sells more books: democractically, its better. (Also Scalzi says SF is just a subset of Fantasy.)

Just add a map in the front, that's fantasy.

Use the word quantum a lot and your magic becomes SF.

Can we throw more petrol on the genre bonfire? We get together in Cambridge for a face off between the BSFA (British Science Fiction Society) and the BFS (British Fantasy Society). We'll be at the [Blue Moon pub](https://cambridge.pub/blue-moon/) for some good natured talk-off about SF worlds vs Fantasy worlds, and the rules for worldbuilding in each (if there really even are any). 

(*If you're in any doubt most people attending will be ardent supporters of both but there's no harm in a little rap-style shade throwing. After all SF may not even be in the top 3 of genres...*)

# Some ideas already thrown in the pit of Scantasy:
- Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun
- Elves with guns
- Cyberpunk evolution of pixies, ogres and angels

# Want to come?
- Great, just turn up, but it would be helpful if you let <Link target="_insta" href="https://linktr.ee/alexcochranwriter">Alex Cochran</Link> know you're coming so we can ensure there will be enough seats at the Blue Moon.
- If you indicate which side you might be rooting for!
- Feel free to begin the tussle online on BSFA Discord or BlueSky.
