# THE BIG SMACKDOWN - Science Fiction Vs Fantasy!

![Meet at the Moon, Science Fiction Vs Fantasy or Does Scantasy exist?](/images/meetatthemoon2.jpg)
In its role as the arbiter of world building genres, Eastworlds will host BSFA, BFS and others in a tongue in cheek battle of the titans: Science
Fiction versus Fantasy. 

Is it that simple or can we throw some more petrol on the genre bonfire? We are getting together in Cambridge for a face off between the BSFA (British Science Fiction Society) and the BFS (British Fantasy Society). We'll be at the [Blue Moon pub](https://cambridge.pub/blue-moon/) for some good natured talk-off about SF worlds vs Fantasy worlds, and the rules for worldbuilding in each (if there really even are any). 

# Some ideas already thrown in the pit:
- Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun
- Elves with guns
- Cyberpunk evolution of pixies, ogres and angels
- Just add a map in the front, that's fantasy
- Use the word quantum a lot and your magic becomes SF
