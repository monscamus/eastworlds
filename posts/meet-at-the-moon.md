# DATE TO BE DECIDED!

![Meet at the Moon, Does Scantasy exist?](/images/meetatthemoon2.jpg)John Scalzi recently argued on BlueSky that science fiction is just a form of fantasy. Historically SF thought of itself as fantasy's big brother until the 70s saw
the overthrow of that situation, even in current day publishing fantasy sales are many multiples of poor old science fiction. But films and games seem to have inkected new life into the old dog. Could it be that the tables are turning? Or are we all happy that the genre barrier is the emperor's new bookshelf?

Is it that simple or can we throw some more petrol on the genre bonfire? We are getting together in Cambridge for a face off between the BSFA (British Science Fiction Society) and the BFS (British Fantasy Society). We'll be at the [Blue Moon pub](https://cambridge.pub/blue-moon/) for some good natured talk-off about SF worlds vs Fantasy worlds, the rules for such (if there really even are any). 

# Some ideas already thrown in the pit:
- Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun
- Elves with guns
- Cyberpunk evolution of pixies, ogres and angels

The next MEET AT THE MOON will be in June!
