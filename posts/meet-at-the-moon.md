Much as with Scalzi's blog here, we are getting together in Cambridge for a face off between the BSFA (British Science Fiction Society) and the BFS (British Fantasy Society). We'll be at the Blue Moon pub for some good natured talk-off about SF worlds vs Fantasy worlds, the rules for such (if there really even are any). 

The next MEET AT THE MOON will be in June!
